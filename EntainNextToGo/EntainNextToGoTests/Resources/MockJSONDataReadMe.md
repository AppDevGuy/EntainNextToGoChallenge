### MockRaceData.json

```
// The time and date for creating the file was 27th February 19:55:09
// Maintain this time for reference.
private let mockDate = Date(fromString: "27 02 2024 19:56:09")
```

### Mock100Races.json

For the Mock 100 Races, which ironically only has 44, we need to use this time reference:

```
// The time and date for creating the file was 2nd March 2024 14:32
// Maintain this time for reference.
private let mockDate = Date(fromString: "2 03 2024 14:32:56")
```
