THAT'S JUSTIFIED (1) is a quality veteran gelding who was third when resuming in a tougher field here 2 weeks ago. He has won 20 times on this track and can add to that tally here, especially with the aid of a 3-kilo claim. ZELRING (4) is another tough campaigner who almost races exclusively on this track. He might need the run but is very nicely placed at the weights and he can never be ruled out in any field here."},"venue_id":"afa0f0ad-50a1-43ff-82c3-c229722cfb36","venue_name":"Alice Springs","venue_state":"NT","venue_country":"AUS"},"9b7343b7-d442-4395-b756-d0ee97eed7bf":{"race_id":"9b7343b7-d442-4395-b756-d0ee97eed7bf","race_name":"Tab Venue Mode","race_number":1,"meeting_id":"edc0c1e8-a58a-4f80-9e12-4c420ddaf620","meeting_name":"Ipswich","category_id":"9daef0d7-bf3c-4f50-921d-8e818c60fe61","advertised_start":{"seconds":1709363880},"race_form":{"distance":520,"distance_type":{"id":"570775ae-09ec-42d5-989d-7c8f06366aa7","name":"Metres","short_name":"m"},"distance_type_id":"570775ae-09ec-42d5-989d-7c8f06366aa7","track_condition":{"id":"10a14653-a33d-11e7-810d-0a1a4ae29bd2","name":"Good","short_name":"good"},"track_condition_id":"10a14653-a33d-11e7-810d-0a1a4ae29bd2","weather":{"id":"187e38d4-ab03-11e7-85e3-0641c90711b8","name":"Showers","short_name":"showers","icon_uri":"Showers"},"weather_id":"187e38d4-ab03-11e7-85e3-0641c90711b8","race_comment":"DAWSON'S BEAR (1) turned in a plain effort last time when sixth at this track over 431m behind Kinematic (26.96) in a Maiden.

GULLY GIRL (7) turned in a better effort at this track last start, finishing second behind Express Pearl (30.05) in a Grade 5. Has the early speed to land on the pace and can stick on. Didn't win last time but still ran one of the quickest times on the card. Leading player again. WEST END RIOT (5) warrants respect following a recent placing."},"venue_id":"1068331f-32f8-42f6-b3ce-d8573358464e","venue_name":"The Gardens","venue_state":"NSW","venue_country":"AUS"},"fb499a4c-840c-4a4b-b8c4-9dd29ca094e9":{"race_id":"fb499a4c-840c-4a4b-b8c4-9dd29ca094e9","race_name":"Doval Construction Group (Bm55)","race_number":7,"meeting_id":"beaed7c7-dc3d-43b9-8227-6683d3e464cc","meeting_name":"Gold Coast Poly","category_id":"4a2788f8-e825-4d36-9894-efd4baf1cfae","advertised_start":{"seconds":1709361900},"race_form":{"distance":1050,"distance_type":{"id":"570775ae-09ec-42d5-989d-7c8f06366aa7","name":"Metres","short_name":"m"},"distance_type_id":"570775ae-09ec-42d5-989d-7c8f06366aa7","track_condition":{"id":"9d03760c-88d2-4c89-9611-ae6eb7cdb76c","name":"Synthetic","short_name":"synthetic"},"track_condition_id":"9d03760c-88d2-4c89-9611-ae6eb7cdb76c","weather":{"id":"08e5f78c-1a36-11eb-9269-cef03e67f1a3","name":"FINE","short_name":"fine","icon_uri":"FINE"},"weather_id":"08e5f78c-1a36-11eb-9269-cef03e67f1a3","race_comment":"MY DOG DIESEL (1) loves racing at this circuit with two wins and five placings from just eight attempts and will have come on with that first-up run now under the belt.
